<h1>Setting up and using Proton VPN in an Azure Virtual Machine</h1>
In this tutorial, we will be creating a virtual machine using Microsoft Azure, registering for the free version of Proton VPN (in our own machine, not the VM), testing the VPN connection and observing the new IPs generated by the VM region and then by the VM using the VPN After that we will browse different sites noticing differences using VPN and just using our local connection. <br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines)
- Remote Desktop
- Proton VPN

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>Steps</h2>

- Create a Virtual Machine in Azure.
- Sign up for ProtonVPN and test the VPN connection.
- Check and note the different IPs we will be using between our actual PCs, our VM and our VM using Proton VPN.
- Clean up your Azure resources.

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

- We will start this step by using https://whatismyipaddress.com/ to check our actual machine's IP address - Mine is currently set to the Ontario Region.
- We proceed by creating our Virtual Machine in the Azure Portal using a different Region from the one you are currently at.
- Connect to your newly created VM using Remote Desktop (if you need help connecting to your VM through Remote Desktop you can check my previous tutorial that teaches you step-by-step how to do this (https://github.com/RafaBelmonte/testproject)
- From your VM, open Microsoft Edge and use the same "whatsmyipaddress" website to check for any changes. As you can see on image3 - my VM is connected in Tokyo, Japan. You can see our Home page in Japanese!
- Next, we will check our IP again after downloading, registering and running the free version of Proton VPN. (Since our VM's Home page is in Japanese or a language you might not speak, do the following steps from your personal computer so we can get the URL to download the VPN from the VM)
- Navigate to https://protonvpn.com and click on "Create free account", Pick the "Get VPN Free" choice and follow the steps to register.
- Take note of the URL so we can copy and paste it to our VM browser.
- Copy and paste the URL to your VMs Microsoft Edge browser and use your credentials to log in and download and install Proton VPN.
- Once installed, run the program, log in with your credentials and the program should run and it will look like displayed on image10
- In this case, since from Japan I did not have free options to pick from Proton VPN, I used the "Quick Connect" option and my IP was then redirected to Warsaw.
- Next, we can navigate to a random website like Netflix or Disney and observe the changes by using our VPN. As you can see, we are now connected to Netflix Poland!
- And with this, we conclude our VPN setup and connection tutorial! If you made it this far, Good job! If not, keep practicing these steps, read through them carefully and I am sure you will succeed!
